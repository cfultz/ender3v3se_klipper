# ender3v3se_klipper

Settings for my Ender 3 V3 SE using Klipper firmware (since I FINALLY dialed it in)

This is my private configuration settings and may work on your device. However, this is NOT recommended to be plug-and-play with any ender 3 v3 se running klipper. This configuraiton CAN AND WILL cause damages if not correctly dialed in by hand.

## Tools I used to help dial it in

- [Setting up X, Y, and Z Access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y35XzPKjUs) (NOTE: See spreadsheet below)
- [Klipper Config Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E3xMJHhx9OcDkdi4KRdfeIvg20nwqvNXuamhrU_2FBw/edit?gid=2006896654#gid=2006896654)
- [Artamis' Ultimate Guide](https://artamis.me/projects/klipper_guide/)
- [Feral Engineer's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV9qXf4cloY) (NOTE: This helped me get Klipper firmware flashed correctly)
- [Running Fluidd and Mainsail together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1Z_ysVig_4)
